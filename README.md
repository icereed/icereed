# 👋 Hi, I’m Dominik Schröter (aka Icereed)

I'm a software engineer and DevOps specialist with a passion for automating the boring stuff – from document processing to tax reporting.

- 🏗️ Lead Architect & Hands-On Coder at BMW, building internal developer platforms and SaaS systems at scale
- 🧠 Maintainer of [paperless-gpt](https://github.com/Icereed/paperless-gpt) – AI-powered metadata extraction for documents
- 💼 Founder of [BubbleTax.de](https://bubbletax.de/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile&utm_campaign=icereed) – BMF-compliant tax reports for Interactive Brokers traders in Germany
- 🔧 Focused on Go, TypeScript, Python, Kubernetes, Postgres, GitHub Actions, LLMs & automation pipelines
- 🛡️ Believer in open standards, transparency & reproducibility

I build tools I need – then share them, so others don’t have to start from scratch.
